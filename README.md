So, hey...

I'm Alex, currently a Senior Staff Engineer at Shopify - but that's not the main event here, if you want my CV [that's what LinkedIn is for](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexdgarland/).

Rather I'm going to use [some of this space](history_and_philosophy.md) for a more general "who am I" kind of thing, some of it for TBC "kind of like a blog but not really" stuff, and more generally just kind of iterate on things as I go...

- As a starter, I have [_Some Thoughts About Books_](one_book_one_lesson.md).
