I'm Alex :wave:

Currently a Senior Staff Engineer working on Data Platform systems and infrastructure at Shopify - [more here on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexdgarland/).

Quite keen on "JVM languages that aren't Java" (Scala, Kotlin) but will also use Python fairly enthusiastically and find bouncing between other languages and technologies interesting. Latest work may be well be in private repos but hopefully what is public gives some sense of what I get up to!
