So, hey...

I'm Alex, currently a Senior Staff Engineer at Shopify - but that's not the main event here, if you want my CV [that's what LinkedIn is for](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexdgarland/).

Rather I'm going to use [some of this space](history_and_philosophy.md) for a more general "who am I" kind of thing, some of it for TBC "kind of like a blog but not really" stuff, and more generally just kind of iterate on things as I go...

- As a starter, I have [_Some Thoughts About Books_](one_book_one_lesson.md).

Also please note (and no, I'm not going to paste this across every file like an Apache license, but please assume it applies throughout) that anything written here reflects my views and not those of any employer - past, present or future.
